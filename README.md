# Sakura Kade Hansen - Software Developer
Hello! My name is Sakura Kade Hansen, and I'm a software developer with experience working on various hobby and solo projects. I specialize in `C++` and `C#` and enjoy creating custom command line, desktop, and backend applications that fulfill specific requirements.<br>
While I have yet to have the opportunity to contribute to any open-source projects, I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating with you to bring your vision to life!<br>
